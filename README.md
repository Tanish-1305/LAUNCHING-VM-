# LAUNCHING-VM-
Launching a virtual machine (VM) on AWS is primarily done through Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud). Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

Step 1: Sign in to AWS Management Console
Go to the AWS Management Console.
Log in with your AWS account credentials.
Step 2: Open the EC2 Dashboard
In the AWS Management Console, search for "EC2" in the services search bar.
Click on "EC2" to open the EC2 Dashboard.
Step 3: Launch an Instance
Click on the “Launch Instance” button.
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Select a pre-configured template that includes the OS and software you want. You can filter by operating system or other features.
Choose an Instance Type: Select an instance type based on your required CPU, memory, and storage. The “t2.micro” instance is eligible for the free tier.
Configure Instance: Set options such as the number of instances, network settings, and IAM roles. Default settings are often sufficient for basic use.
Add Storage: Modify the default storage size if needed. The default is usually sufficient for general use.
Add Tags: Optionally, add tags to help identify your instance (e.g., Name: MyInstance).
Configure Security Group: Set up a security group to control inbound and outbound traffic. You can create a new group or select an existing one. Make sure to allow SSH (port 22) for Linux instances or RDP (port 3389) for Windows instances.
Step 4: Review and Launch
Review your instance configuration.
Click on the “Launch” button.
You will be prompted to select an existing key pair or create a new one. This key pair is necessary for accessing your instance later.
After selecting or creating the key pair, acknowledge the terms and click “Launch Instances.”
Step 5: Access Your Instance
Once your instance is running, you can find it in the “Instances” section of the EC2 Dashboard.
To connect to a Linux instance, use an SSH client:
Open your terminal (or command prompt).
Use the command:
bash
Copy code
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
For Windows instances, use RDP:
Download the RDP file from the EC2 console.
Use your key pair to obtain the password.
Step 6: Manage Your Instance
Monitor and manage your instance from the EC2 Dashboard.
You can stop, terminate, or modify your instance as needed.
Additional Tips
Cost Management: Keep an eye on the usage to avoid unexpected charges. Use the AWS Free Tier if you're eligible.
Security: Regularly update your instance and manage security groups carefully.
